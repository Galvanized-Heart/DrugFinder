# DrugFinder

## Description:
A data pipeline that incorporates the ChEMBL REST API for finding drug targets and all potential assosiated drugs. Using the data associated with these drugs, the user may compute the Lipinski descriptors to identify drug candidates that may be ideal for oral uptake or create a model using machine learning to generate a trend between actual IC50 and the predicted IC50.
